<h1>Links</h1>
Any links which are worth referencing but haven't made their way into other docs yet

--------

* [react-keyframes](https://github.com/zeit/react-keyframes) 
"A react component for creating frame-based animations" |

`Example`
```
@keyframes App-logo-spin {
  from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
``` 

* [babel-plugin-react-css-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-css-modules) 
The package is still fairly new so avoiding at the moment. That said, could make importing much easier.
