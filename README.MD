<h1>React Firebase</h1>
I was playing with create-react-app and firebase this weekend. 
Realized that there are some configuration issues which I wouldn't to iron out.
This is a starting point for future react-firebase apps for myself. Feel free to use/fork.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To avoid typing `npm run` repeatedly, check out [ALIAS](docs/ALIAS.MD)

----------

1. Develop
```
npm i
npm start
```

2. Test
```
npm run test
```

3. Deploy
```
nano package.json -> replace "homepage" with your project name
nano .firebaserc -> add your firebase project name here
npm run fireup
```

| [JOURNEY](docs/JOURNEY.MD) | Something about the build process gets screwed up between **create-react-app** and **firebase**. This journey doc delineates the haphazard steps I took to fix it.  |
