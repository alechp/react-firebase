<h1>React Firebase</h1>
I was playing with create-react-app and firebase this weekend. 
Realized that there are some configuration issues which I wouldn't to iron out.
This is a starting point for future react-firebase apps for myself. Feel free to use/fork.

<h2>Firebase</h2>
Why use?

<h4>Pros</h4>
* Free SSL included (i.e. imagine integrated [Let's Encrypt](https://goo.gl/WY8sZT))
* Easy custom domain management (i.e. imagine easy [Route53](https://goo.gl/klcGZq))
* Integrated OAuth management (i.e. imagine a slim version of [Auth0](https://goo.gl/4S7WYp))
* Easy host deployment (i.e. imagine [surge.sh](https://goo.gl/s0dK7T) with more robust environment)
* Easy state management (i.e. imagine a highly-restrictive [Relay](https://goo.gl/r54eBC) framework)
* Inexpensive  

<h4>Cons</h4>
* Extreme vendor lock-in
* Their database GUI is clunky IMO
* JSON Tree utilize recursive queries. As a result, you're limited from nesting data. They allow 32 levels, but strongly advise keeping data shallow.
